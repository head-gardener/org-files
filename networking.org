* Configuring the network
My net setup sucks, primarely because i know shit all about network
equipment and protocols. At least openwrt interface wakes it easier to
fiddle with. I probably should ssh into it and look into logs, atops,
netstats and such to figure out how really does it all work.

** IPv6
My main pc doesn't get an IPv6 address, at least I don't think it
does. Is there something I can do about it? Or should?

** Firewall
Somehow I'm completely oblivious to how the firewall works. Should
probably figure it out.

** Nix-box as a router
Once I understand all the stuff, I could switch to everything being
handled by a Nix-ed ThinkPad. [[http://www.willghatch.net/blog/2020/06/22/nixos-raspberry-pi-4-google-fiber-router/?utm_source=all&utm_medium=RSS][Another post]]. This ties back into [[file:deploy.org::*Deploy andshee][reorganizing my configs]].
