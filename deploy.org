* Deploy and shee
** Remove references to external files
*** TODO find a better way to store ssh keys
prob best to store separate pub_keys.nix and swap it as needed.
throw some code generating lisp stuff on top and it's golden.
** Clear separation of services
[[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/NixOS_modules][on modules]]
- nix-serve
- hydra
- prometheus
** Damn flakes
[[https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-05-25-flakes/][Dolstra's post]]
Usefull with managing dependencies like reguralry updated git repos.
*** TODO Separate nix-serve and all realted mush
Maybe these services should reside in separate files as functions operating on config objects.
** Prometheus
Agregate metrics just for fun i guess. for example hydra's shit, if at all possible.
You could even agregate shit like atop-s metrics. Very cool!
